## 💡 Implementation Notes

- **Scroll Pinning**: The main hero section uses GSAP `pin` to hold the view while internal animations (like scaling the "window") occur.
- **GSAP Context**: Uses `@gsap/react` for safe cleaning of animations in React's development mode.
- **Z-Index Strategy**: Specific layering in `SmoothScrollHero.jsx` ensures the logo remains interactive while the "sky" moves behind it.
